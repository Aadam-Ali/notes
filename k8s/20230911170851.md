# Pods

## What are Pods?

* A Pod is where deployed apps run
* Run `kubectl explain pods --recursive` to find out more information

## Pod features

* Labels - attach identifying data, can be used to group Pods and
  associate them with other objects
* Annotations - attach non-identifying data, used by tools and libraries
* Probes - used to test the health and status of Pods and the
  applications running in them
* Affinity and non-affinity rules - provides control over where Pods are
  allowed to run
* Termination control - lets you gracefully terminate Pods and the
  applications running within them
* Security policies - enforce security features
* Resources requests and limits - allows you to specify minimum and
  maximum values for resources

## Shared resources

* Pods allow containers to share resources e.g. filesystem, network
  stack, memory, and volumes

## Static Pods

* Static Pods are deployed via a Pod manifest
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pods
metadata:
  name: hello-pod
  labels:
    zone: prod
    version: v1
  spec:
    containers:
    - name: hello-ctr
    - image: nginx:1.25.2
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```
* They don't come with the benefits of being managed by a controller
  i.e. no self healing
* Directly managed by a kubelet daemon on a single node

## Controller Pods

* Have the benefits of being managed by a controller
* The generally used way of managing Pods

## Deploying a Pod

1. Define a manifest
1. POST the YAML to the API server
1. API server authenticates and authorises the request
1. The manifest is validated
1. Scheduler deploys the Pod to a worker node
1. The local kubelet daemon monitors it
* Pod deployments are atomic

## Pod anatomy

* Pods share the same namespaces:
  * net namespace - virtualised network stack
  * pid namespace - indepentent set of process IDs
  * mnt namespace - volumes
  * UTS (UNIX Time-Sharing) namespace - unique hostnames and domain
    names
  * IPC (Inter-process Communication) namespace - manages shared memory

## Pod network

* All Pods get a unique IP address that is fully routable on an internal
  kubernetes network
* Allows all Pods to communicate with each other via a flat overlay
  network regardless of the physical network that they exist within
  (assumming connectivity of the physical networks)
* Default pod network is not secure and should be tightened with
  Kubernetes Network Policies

## Types of Pod workloads

* Long-lived Pods are ones which should stay running indefinitely, the
  kubelet should attempt to restart them should they fail - restart
  policy permitting (`Always, OnFailure, Never`)
* Short-lived Pods only run until a task is complete e.g. a batch job,
  once all the containers in a Pod successfully terminates, the Pod will
* Long-lived workload controllers include `Deployments, StatefulSets,
  and DaemonSets`
* Short-lived workload controllers include `Jobs, and CronJobs`

## Scaling

* Since Pods run a single application container instance, they scale
  horizontally i.e. new Pods are added or removed

## Multicontainer Pods

* Multiple containers should be used to 'seperate concerns'
* Multicontainer Pods can be used to ensure tightly coupled process can
  run together in a shared execution environment - particularly
  important for service meshes
* There are multiple patterns for multicontainer Pods:
  * Sidecar - a primary application container and secondary 'sidecar'
    container to carry out tasks for the primary container
  * Adapter - variation of the sidecar pattern to reformat non-standard
    output from the primary container to one required elsewhere
  * Ambassador - variation of the sidecar pattern where the primary
    container exposes data to a port that the ambassador is listening
    to, the ambassador then sends that data elsewhere
  * Init - A secondary container that runs only once to initialise the
    environment for the primary container, the primary container won't
    start until the init container completes
